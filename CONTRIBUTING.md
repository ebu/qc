## Collaboration Streams

This work builds on two complementary strands of collaboration:

### 1. EBU Quality Control (QC) Group
The **EBU QC group** coordinates and progresses the standardization and specification aspects of the work, including the contents of this repo.  
Participants are encouraged to join via [https://tech.ebu.ch/qc](https://tech.ebu.ch/qc) to stay informed about the latest meetings and developments.  
The group typically holds **quarterly calls**, with additional meetings as needed to progress specific topics.

### 2. EBU QC Implementers Group
The **QC Implementers group** (see [https://tech.ebu.ch/qci](https://tech.ebu.ch/qci)) brings together implementers of QC specifications to:
- Study real QC use cases and workflows.
- Extend and refine data schemas (QC profiles, QC reports, and QC test catalogues).
- Define, update, and validate QC tests to ensure interoperable implementations.

## Code of Conduct

To maintain a welcoming and respectful environment, please follow these basic principles:

- Be respectful, considerate, and constructive in all communications.
- Welcome new ideas and be open to different viewpoints.
- Keep discussions focused, factual, and aimed at solving problems together.
- Assume good intent — everyone is here to contribute positively.
- Respect others’ time and efforts by keeping your contributions clear and well-documented.

Harassment or disrespectful behavior is not tolerated under any circumstances.
